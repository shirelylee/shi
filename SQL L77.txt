Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number
 of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the 
total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one 
student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result 
by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of 
challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges
 created, then exclude those students from the result.

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the 
challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the
 hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the 
same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers 
with a total score of  from your result.

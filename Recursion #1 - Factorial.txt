with recursive f(n, fact) as (
  select 0, 1::bigint
  union all
  select n + 1, fact * (n + 1)
  from f
)
select n, fact
from f
limit 17
-------------------------------

SELECT 
    0, 
    DATENAME(DW, 0)

SELECT    
        n + 1, 
        DATENAME(DW, n + 1)
    FROM    
        cte_numbers
    WHERE n < 6

fitst select is  0,1   becasue when n is 0, the fact should be 1..
second select
n+1, algorithm ..
in this practise algorithm is fact*(n+1)

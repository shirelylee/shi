Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number
 of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the 
total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one 
student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result 
by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of 
challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges
 created, then exclude those students from the result.

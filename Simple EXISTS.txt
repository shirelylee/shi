In general, use EXISTS when:

You don't need to return data from the related table
You have dupes in the related table (JOIN can cause duplicate rows if values are repeated)
You want to check existence (use instead of LEFT OUTER JOIN...NULL condition)
----------------------------------------------------

select 
id,
name
from 
departments
where exists(
select 
  price from sales where sales.department_id=departments.id and price>98
)

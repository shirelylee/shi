For this challenge you need to create a VIEW. This VIEW is used by a sales store to
 give out vouches to members who have spent over $1000 in departments that have brought
 in more than $10000 total ordered by the members id. The VIEW must be called members_approved_for_voucher 
then you must create a SELECT query using the view.
create view members_approved_for_voucher as

select
m.id,
m.name,
m.email,
sum(p.price) as total_spending
from members m
inner join sales s on m.id=s.member_id
inner join products p on p.id=s.product_id
where s.department_id in(
                          select s2.department_id
                            from sales s2
                            inner join products p2
                            on s2.product_id=p2.id
                            group by s2.department_id
                            having sum(p2.price)>10000
                        )
group by m.id,m.name,m.email
having sum(p.price) > 1000
order by m.id;

select * from
members_approved_for_voucher;

--------------------------------------
If a book has been sold less than 10 copies, then there are two cases. The first case is that 
the book has been sold at least 1 copy but less than
 10 copies. The second case is that the book has never been sold.
For the second case, select the books such that the book_id values are not in Orders.

The selection criteria also include that available_from is more than 1 month from the given date, and dispatch_date is in the last year.

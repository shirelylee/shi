Your task is to create a SQL query which returns the maximum number of simultaneous uses of a service. 
Each usage ("visit") is logged with its entry and exit timestamps in a "visits" table 
structured as follows:

id          primary key
entry_time  timestamp of visit start
exit_time   timestamp of visit end

A visit starts at entry time and ends at exit time. At exactly exit time 
the visit is considered to have already finished. The visits table always 
contains at least one entry. Your query should return a single row, containing 
the following columns:

when_happened  earliest timestamp when there were visits_count concurrent visits
visits_count   maximum count of overlapping visits
